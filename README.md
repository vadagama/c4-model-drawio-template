## Template
This is a draw.io template for creating C4 Model diagrams  - [C4 Model Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vadagama/c4-model-drawio-template/main/c4.drawio)

The template includes the following:
1. **context** - Context diagram
3. **container** - Container diagram
4. **component** - Component diagram
5. **deployment** - Deployment diagram
6. **minimal** - Minimalistic C4 diagram without descriptions and technology details
7. **shapes** - all C4 Model shapes on one page


3. Download the template and open it in draw.io. When you open the template, you will see a list of diagrams. Click on the diagram you want to create and start editing.

# Context diagram
The context diagram is the highest level of abstraction and is a starting point for the C4 Model. It shows the system in scope and its interactions with external systems.
